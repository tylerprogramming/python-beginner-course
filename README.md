What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It's widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and automation.

Installing Python
To install Python, follow these steps:

Go to the official Python website.
Download the latest version for your operating system.
Run the installer and follow the instructions. Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH".
Setting up a Development Environment
You can write Python code in various environments. A popular choice for beginners is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm, VSCode, or using a simple text editor like Sublime Text. Additionally, Jupyter Notebooks are excellent for data analysis and visualization.

Example of setting up VSCode:

Install Visual Studio Code.
Install the Python extension from the VSCode marketplace.
Open VSCode and create a new file with a .py extension.
Write your Python code and run it by pressing Ctrl+Shift+B.

# Basic Syntax and Operations
## Variables and Data Types
### Explanation: Variables store information to be used in a program. Common data types in Python include integers, floats, strings, and booleans.

### Code Example:

```python
name = "Alice"        # String
age = 25              # Integer

print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
```

## Basic Operations (Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical)
### Explanation: Arithmetic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation. Comparison operations compare values and return boolean results. Logical operations include and, or, and not.

Code Example:


## Strings and String Operations
### Explanation: Strings are sequences of characters. You can perform various operations on strings, such as concatenation, slicing, and using built-in methods to manipulate the string.

Code Example:

# Control Flow
## Conditional Statements (if, else, elif)
### Explanation: Conditional statements allow you to execute code based on certain conditions.

Code Example:

## Loops (for, while)
### Explanation: Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times.

Code Example:

# Data Structures
## Lists
### Explanation: Lists are ordered collections of items that are changeable and allow duplicate elements.

Code Example:

## Tuples
### Explanation: Tuples are ordered collections of items that are immutable and allow duplicate elements.

Code Example:

## Dictionaries
### Explanation: Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. Keys must be unique and immutable.

Code Example:

# Functions
## Defining Functions
### Explanation: Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.

## Function Arguments and Return Values
### Explanation: Functions can accept parameters and return values.

# Modules and Packages
## Importing Modules
### Explanation: Modules are files containing Python code that can be imported and used in other Python programs.

## Using Standard Library Modules
### Explanation: Python's standard library includes many modules that provide useful functionality.

# File Handling
## Reading from and Writing to Files
### Explanation: Python can read from and write to files using built-in functions.

# Exception Handling
## Try, Except Blocks
### Explanation: Exception handling allows you to handle errors gracefully in your code.

# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming
## Classes and Objects
### Explanation: Classes define the blueprint for objects, and objects are instances of classes.

## Methods and Attributes
### Explanation: Methods are functions defined within a class, and attributes are variables defined within a class.

### Let's create a simple contact book application that allows you to add, view, and delete contacts.


# 1. Introduction to Databases
## Explanation:
### A database is a structured collection of data. SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to manage and manipulate relational databases. SQLite is a lightweight, disk-based database that doesn't require a separate server process, making it ideal for embedding in applications. SQLAlchemy is a Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library that provides a flexible interface for interacting with databases.
## Sqlite:
### SQLite is part of the Python standard library, so no installation is required. You can interact with SQLite using the sqlite3 module.
